# UE5_GameplaySystems

## 🎮 Project Overview
**UE5_GameplaySystems** is a gameplay systems–focused project built using  
**Unreal Engine 5** and **C++**.

The goal of this repository is to explore **gameplay architecture, engine behavior,
and system-level experimentation** using Unreal Engine’s C++ framework.
This is not a finished commercial game, but a structured and evolving systems project.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build gameplay systems using C++ as the foundation
- Understand Unreal Engine’s gameplay lifecycle and architecture
- Use Blueprint as an extension layer over C++ logic
- Maintain clean version control and documentation

---

## 🚀 Current Scope
- Third Person C++ project as a foundation
- Custom debugging and logging tools
- Gameplay framework analysis (GameMode, Character, Actors)
- Input-driven gameplay behavior (planned)
- Clean version control with focused commits
- Blueprint ↔ C++ inheritance workflow

---

### 🔹 Third Person Character (Template)
- Movement, jumping, and camera logic provided by Unreal Engine
- Used as a stable base for future gameplay systems

---
## 🧩 Gameplay Framework Focus
This project emphasizes understanding **responsibilities**, not just features:

- **GameMode** – Game rules and default class definitions
- **Character** – Player representation and movement systems
- **Actors** – Lifecycle, ticking, and runtime behavior
- **Components** – Modular gameplay logic (ongoing)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5
- **Language**: C++
- **Template**: Third Person (C++)
- **Version Control**: GitHub
